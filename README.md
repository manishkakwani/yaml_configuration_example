This is a sample project I cloned from Railscasts to practice proper
configuration of environment variables with yml files.

# RailsCasts Example Application

Run these commands to try it out.

```
bundle
cp config/application.example.yml config/application.yml
rake db:setup
rails s
```

Requires Ruby 1.9.2 or later to run.
